    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a software developer based in Leeds in the UK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since 2008 I've been working as a freelance web developer
      building apps with Ruby and Rails. I've also spent time teaching
      Ruby to school children and on occasion Rails to adults.
    </p>
    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p>
      My expertise is as a back-end web developer. Most of my recent
      experience is with Ruby on Rails, although I'm willing and able
      to learn any modern language or framework if it's the right tool
      for the job.
    </p>
    <p>
      The projects I've worked on recently have typically been built
      with the following tools and frameworks at their core:
      <ul>
        <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
        <li>MySQL</li>
        <li>Rspec/Capybara</li>
        <li>jQuery</li>
        <li>Backbone.js</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>
      I'm currently looking for new projects to work on. If you need a
      developer for your project I'd love to chat to you about how I
      can help you. The best way to get in touch with me is to send an
      email
      to <a href="mailto:horsfallp@gmail.com">horsfallp@gmail.com</a>.
