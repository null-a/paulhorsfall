<p>
This post describes a prototype sampling oscilloscope I'm working on.
</p>

<p>
The current prototype probably has a bandwidth around 7 GHz and an
equivalent time sample rate of around 100 Gsps<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
This device is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscilloscope_types#Digital_sampling_oscilloscopes">sampling oscilloscope</a>, not a real-time oscilloscope.
This means that it can only capture repetitive signals. For this and
other reasons, you're not going to be able to put some probes on this
and use it for general circuit debugging. Nevertheless, there are use
cases for this class of instrument.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4662ee6">
<p>
Let me say upfront that I don't take any credit whatsoever for the
high-level design of this device. The basic idea has been around for a
long time, and my take on it borrows heavily from a recent <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/167292-8-ghz-sampling-oscilloscope">project</a> by
Ted Yapo. I provide a slightly more comprehensive <a href="#org25216c1">history</a> below.

<h3 id="org3525ca2">Equivalent Time Sampling</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3525ca2">
<p>
The design builds on the principle of sequential equivalent time
sampling. The idea here is to exploit the (assumed) repetitive nature
of the input signal by collecting samples over multiple repetitions of
the input signal.
</p>

<p>
For example, on the first repetition of the input we might sample the
input at the start of the cycle, call this point in time t=0. Then on
the second repetition we might sample at some small offset from the
start, at say t=&Delta;. On the third repetition we sample at
t=2&Delta;, and so on.
</p>

<p>
The sequence of samples collected in this way captures the input at an
(equivalent) sample rate of 1/&Delta;, with the advantage of not
imposing any restriction on how rapidly the samples are actually
collected.

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>Sequential equivalent time sampling.</p>
</div>

<p>
Any device that implements this approach needs two main components.
First, some kind of sampling device to capture the input at a point in
time, and second a way to precisely control the time at which a sample
is taken within a repetition, traditionally called a time-base.
</p>

<h3 id="org4ac0bc2">Sampling</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4ac0bc2">
<p>
Accurately sampling the input with the requisite bandwidth is a
non-trivial undertaking, especially on a budget.
</p>

<p>
The key idea in this design is to use a comparator as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Successive-approximation_ADC">successive
approximation ADC</a>. It turns out this fits very well with the
sequential equivalent time sampling approach.
</p>

<p>
Since we are assuming the input is repetitive, we can perform the
individual steps of the binary search across multiple repetitions of
the input. This side-steps the problem of the input signal changing
between steps that usually requires a sample and hold circuit in a
successive approximation ADC. Instead, the input can be sampled
directly by a fast (latched) comparator.
</p>

<p>
Comparators with sufficient bandwidth are available off the shelf, and
they are relatively inexpensive.

<h3 id="org186988a">Time-base</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org186988a">
<p>
Sequential equivalent time sampling requires some way to synchronise
the scope and the device under test (DUT). For simplicity, I currently
assume that the DUT can be driven by an external clock<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>. In this
case, the scope itself can generate a clock to drive the DUT, and the
two are synchronised.
</p>

<p>
The only extra functionality that's needed to implement the time-base
is the ability to generate a strobe signal to drive the sampling
comparator, that can be shifted to be any of 0, &Delta;, 2&Delta;,
3&Delta;, etc. seconds behind the clock. There are off the shelf
programmable delay line ICs that do exactly this, with the resolution
required.
</p>

<p>
In order to make accurate measurements it's necessary to calibrate
such a delay line. One approach is to include the delay line as part
of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_oscillator">ring oscillator</a> and measure the oscillator's frequency, from
which the delay length can be calculated<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>.

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 3: </span>Photo of the prototype.</p>
</div>

<p>
The current prototype is split across two PCBs, one each for the
sampling and delay line sub-circuits. I'm using an Analog Devices
ADCMP582 comparator for sampling, and a Micrel SY89296U for the delay
line.
</p>

<p>
The boards were laid out in KiCad, manufactured by JLCPCB, and
assembled by hand.
</p>

<p>
For control I'm using a Raspberry Pi Pico<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
The whole thing is powered from a USB charger. A third-party DC-DC
converter generates positive and negative rails at around ±6.5V. Each
PCB then has local voltage regulation providing 3.3V and/or ±5V.
</p>

<p>
One area of the build that I focused attention on was the footprint of
the SMA connector used at the input. I've shared details of this in a
<a href="https://www.eevblog.com/forum/rf-microwave/sma-connector-footprint-design-project/">thread</a> on the eevblog forum.

<h2 id="orgd0ae825">Testing</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd0ae825">
<p>
Initial testing has been performed using a fast edge generator as the
DUT. This is based on an Analog Devices ADCMP580 comparator, which has
an output capable of generating edges with a 20/80 transition time of
37ps.
</p>

<p>
Here's an example measurement taken with the scope:

<p><img src="images/scope-sweep.png" alt="scope-sweep.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 4: </span>Example sweep captured by the prototype.</p>
</div>

<p>
In principle the transition time of this edge can be used to estimate
the bandwidth of the scope, but I'm yet to implement time-base
calibration so I can't do this accurately. However, the 20/80
transition time of the measured edge (which is very roughly 48ps) is
plausibly consistent with the scope's bandwidth being somewhere close
to the 8 GHz bandwidth of the comparator<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup>.

<h2 id="orgb186c9d">Next Steps</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb186c9d">
<p>
Some obvious next steps include:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Time-base calibration. The hardware already includes the ability to
include the delay line in a ring oscillator. With the addition of a
clock divider I hope to be able to use the Pico as a frequency
counter.</li>
<li>Diagnose and fix the problem causing erroneous samples to
occasionally appear in captured data<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6" role="doc-backlink">6</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Longer term, there are many paths I could take from here, though I've
not yet settled on a specific plan.
