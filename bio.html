<p>
I've worked as a freelance/contract computer programmer since 2008. I
initially worked on web development projects, but later switched to
doing work on probabilistic programming. On recent projects I've
primarily worked with Python and JavaScript, though I have varying
degrees of experience with several other languages, including <a href="https://github.com/null-a/tyche">Haskell</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/null-a/Stochy.jl">Julia</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/null-a/frost/tree/main/system/firmware">C</a>. I also have experience with a range of Python libraries
used for numerical computing, including NumPy, SciPy and PyTorch.

<p>
My recent work has been on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_programming">probabilistic programming</a>, a field at the
intersection of probability theory, programming languages, and machine
learning.
</p>

<p>
From 2015 to 2018 I worked for Stanford University on the <a href="http://webppl.org/">WebPPL</a>
project.
</p>

<p>
The single biggest strand of work I contributed to was a research
project that aimed to bring together ideas from probabilistic
programming and deep neural networks. This is described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05735">Deep
Amortized Inference for Probabilistic Programs</a>.
</p>

<p>
Along side this, I also did all the usual kinds of work required on a
typical software project: fix bugs, refactor, write documentation,
write tests, field issues, etc.
</p>

<p>
During 2018 and 2019 I worked for Uber AI, where the amortized
inference work from WebPPL was being refined and extended by the <a href="https://pyro.ai/">Pyro</a>
project. This is described in <a href="https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/v20/18-403.html">Pyro: Deep Universal Probabilistic
Programming</a>.
</p>

<p>
I contributed an implementation of DeepMind's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08575">Attend, Infer, Repeat</a>
model to the project and wrote a <a href="https://pyro.ai/examples/air.html">tutorial</a> that describes how it works.
</p>

<p>
I also developed <a href="https://github.com/pyro-ppl/brmp#readme">BRMP</a>, a tool that aimed to make it easy to fit
Bayesian regression models using Pyro.

<h2 id="org46b783c">The Web</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org46b783c">
<p>
I have experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript, HTTP, DOM, etc. It's
been a while since I last did any commercial web development, but I do
occasionally use web technologies to create cross-platform GUIs.
</p>

<p>
For example, I built a data annotation tool as part of a machine
learning pipeline, and I developed the infrastructure used to run a
series of adaptive psychology experiments on Mechanical Turk. (See
section 6.3 and appendix D2 of this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05480">paper</a> for more details.)
