* About

I'm a freelance software developer based in Leeds in the UK. My main
interests are the web and machine learning.

I'm currently looking for new projects to work on. If you need a
developer for your project I'd love to chat to you about how I can
help.

The best way to get in touch with me is to send an email to
[[mailto:horsfallp@gmail.com][horsfallp@gmail.com]].
