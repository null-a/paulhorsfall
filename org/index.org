* About

I'm a software developer based in Leeds in the UK. I work on the
probabilistic programming language [[http://webppl.org][WebPPL]].

The best way to get in touch with me is to send an email to
[[mailto:horsfallp@gmail.com][horsfallp@gmail.com]].

- [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09538][Pyro: Deep Universal Probabilistic Programming]]
- I wrote a [[http://pyro.ai/examples/air.html][tutorial]] on the implementation of [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08575][AIR]] in [[http://pyro.ai][Pyro]].
- We shared a tech report that describes progress on a project I'm
  contributing to: [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05735][Deep Amortized Inference for Probabilistic Programs]]
- I've shared my Python/Theano [[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/501760/ml/dbm.tar.gz][Deep Boltzmann Machine]] implementation.
  It includes code to reproduce the MNIST density model result from
  the original paper. It's not cleanly packaged for easy re-use, but
  it might be useful to someone.
- I finished 9th in Kaggle's [[http://www.kaggle.com/c/whale-detection-challenge/leaderboard][whale detection challenge]].
- I wrote about [[file:articles/grbm-sparsity.org][GRBM Sparsity]].
