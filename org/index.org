- I've shared my Python/Theano [[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/501760/ml/dbm.tar.gz][Deep Boltzmann Machine]] implementation.
  It includes code to reproduce the MNIST density model result from
  the original paper. It's not cleanly packaged for easy re-use, but
  it might be useful to someone.
- I finished 9th in Kaggle's [[http://www.kaggle.com/c/whale-detection-challenge/leaderboard][whale detection challenge]].
- I wrote about [[file:articles/grbm-sparsity.org][GRBM Sparsity]].
