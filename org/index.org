#+TITLE: Paul Horsfall

* About

I'm a software developer based in Leeds in the UK.

Since 2008 I've been working as a freelance web developer building
apps with Ruby and Rails. I've also spent time teaching Ruby to school
children and on occasion Rails to adults.

* Skills

My expertise is as a back-end web developer. Most of my recent
experience is with Ruby on Rails, although I'm willing and able to
learn any modern language or framework if it's the right tool for the
job.

The projects I've worked on recently have typically been built with
the following tools and frameworks at their core:

- Ruby on Rails
- MySQL
- Rspec/Capybara
- jQuery
- Backbone.js

* Contact

I'm currently looking for new projects to work on. If you need a
developer for your project I'd love to chat to you about how I can
help you. The best way to get in touch with me is to send an email to
[[mailto:horsfallp@gmail.com][horsfallp@gmail.com]]. Alternatively if you enjoy real ale come find me
