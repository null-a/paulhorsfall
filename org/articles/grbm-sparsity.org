* An Observation

The variance of the visible units of a Gaussian RBM with rectified
linear hidden units affects the sparsity[fn:1] of the representation
learned when the model is trained with contrastive divergence.

* Demonstration

To demonstrate this effect I trained a model with 400 hidden units on
natural image patches. ([[https://github.com/phorsfall/ml/tree/master/ex/grbm/sparsity.py][Source code]].) For each training run the
standard deviation of the visible units (\sigma) was fixed. The visible
units were sampled from during training.[fn:2]

Figure 1 ([[file:images/grbm-sparsity-fig1.png][full size]]) shows how the sparsity in the hidden units
changes during training for several values of \sigma. It's clear that for
this model increasing \sigma increases the sparsity of the learned
representation.

In figure 2 ([[file:images/grbm-sparsity-fig2.png][full size]]) each row shows the first ten features learned
for a particular setting of \sigma. The rows are in order of ascending
variance or equivalently ascending sparsity. Features toward the top
of this figure tend to be short edge detectors or point filters.
Moving down the figure the point filters disappear and the edge
detectors become longer and broader.

* Possible Implications

When an RBM is used as an unsupervised feature extractor it is
sometimes desirable to learn a sparse representation. One way this can
be achieved is by adding an extra term to the optimization objective.
An alternative is to add noise to the visible units during training
and think of the visible variance as a meta-parameter for controlling
sparsity.

If instead the objective is to learn a good generative model it makes
sense to learn the visible variances. In such a setting, the
observation made here suggests that the learning rate and initial
values chosen for the variances could have an appreciable effect on
the learned model.

For example, if the variances are initialized to relatively high
values and a small learning rate is applied to them, then I would
expect the sampling noise present during the early part of training to
induce more sparsity in the hidden units than would be the case with
smaller initial values and a bigger learning rate.[fn:3]

* Footnotes

[fn:1] For a model with rectified linear hidden units sparsity is the
  fraction of hidden units that output a zero, averaged over training
  cases.

[fn:2] If the visible units are not sampled then the variance still
  affects sparsity but in a less predictable way. Furthermore, the
  features learned are more noisy, less local and harder to interpret
  as meaningful features such as edge detectors.

[fn:3] Perhaps it is this phenomenon that Alex Krizhevsky is
  describing in [[http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/learning-features-2009-TR.pdf][Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images]]:
  "The trick to doing this correctly is to set the learning rate of
  the standard deviations to a sufficiently low value. In our
  experience, it should be about 100 to 1000 times smaller than the
  learning rate of the weights. Failure to do so produces a lot of
  point filters that never evolve into edge filters."
